# ClimateWins Analysis

## Introduction
Climate Wins, a European nonprofit organization dedicated to understanding and mitigating the impacts of climate change, aims to leverage machine learning to predict future weather conditions and potential extreme weather events in mainland Europe. By analyzing historical weather data, we hope to use machine learning algorithms to develop models that can provide insights into temperature trends, extreme weather patterns, and overall climate variability. 

## Project Objectives
The analysis aims to answer several key questions to aid Instacartâ€™s marketing and sales strategies:

+ Predict Weather Conditions: Develop models to predict whether weather conditions will be favorable on a certain day.
+ Analyze Climate Trends: Identify and analyze trends in temperature and extreme weather events over the past several decades.
+ Model Performance Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of different machine learning models in predicting weather conditions and identifying climate patterns.

## Data
The data used by ClimateWins is the European Climate Assessment and Dataset (ECA&D), collected and funded by the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI). The ECA&D dataset includes a wide range of weather information, such as temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and humidity, from 18 weather stations across Europe. It spans multiple decades, enabling detailed analysis of historical weather patterns and trends. The data from the ECA&D is meticulously collected and validated by the KNMI to ensure high accuracy and reliability. The weather stations are strategically located across Europe, providing a representative sample of the continent's diverse climate conditions. 

## Methodology
The analysis employs Python for data processing and exploratory analysis, utilizing libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy, and seaborn for data manipulation and visualization. Key steps include:

+ Data Preprocessing:
  + Variables were scaled using standardization techniques.
  + Data was split into testing and training data.
  + Data was segmented for comparision of models fit to both simple and compley datasets. 
+ Model Development:
  + Gradient Descent Optimization
  + K-Nearest Neighbors
  + Desicion Tree
  + Aritificial Neural Network
+ Model Evaluation and Refinement:
  + The models' performance was evaluated on both training and testing data
  + Cross-validation techniques were used to ensure robustness and reliability of the model evaluation.
  + Models were assessed for signs of overfitting or underfitting, and adjustments were made to balance complexity and generalizability.

## Deliverables
The repository contains the following deliverables:

+ [Python Code](<ClimateWins Scripts>): Scripts used for data analysis.
+ [Interim Presentation](<ClimateWins Reports>): An interim presentation providing analysis methods, visualizations, and model recommendations.
